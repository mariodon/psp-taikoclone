I intended to do this in python because i've not got much coding in c for a long time.

...

I did small experiment using stackless-python, yeah, and i can't got everything do fast.so i finally decided to do this in c.

OSLib for grahics (add a little funcility to speed up note drawing)
aalib for music and hitsound(~~modified a little so that i can get play position of the music~~)

psplink is really a powerful tool!

little by little, i've finish a lot of things.
I didn't try to finish a project by myself, because I thought that's too hard for me. But now, I'm more confident.

This project is abandoned, because it is very difficult to simulate all the fancy animations used in original Taiko No Tatsujin game.
However, i started a new project hosted at Github, which starts with a implementation of the animation system which works almost the same as the original game, and uses the original game's resources.

check it out if you're instrested.
